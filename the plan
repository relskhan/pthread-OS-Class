Hi, 

To make the code multi-threaded, we don't have to physically partition s1. If we first consider a sequential solution, what a single thread would do is this:
At s1[0], search for n2 consecutive chars and see if they are identical to s2;
At s1[1], search for n2 consecutive chars and see if they are identical to s2;
At s1[2], search for n2 consecutive chars and see if they are identical to s2;
At s1[3], search for n2 consecutive chars and see if they are identical to s2;
......
If we have two threads, instead of having them search first/second half of s1, you can do:
t0 at s1[0], search for n2 consecutive chars and see if they are identical to s2;
t1 at s1[1], search for n2 consecutive chars and see if they are identical to s2;
t0 at s1[2], search for n2 consecutive chars and see if they are identical to s2;
t1 at s1[3], search for n2 consecutive chars and see if they are identical to s2
